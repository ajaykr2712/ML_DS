# ML_DS Continuous Integration and Deployment

## CI/CD Pipeline Configuration

This document outlines the continuous integration and deployment pipeline for the ML_DS project.

### GitHub Actions Workflow

The pipeline includes:
- **Code Quality Checks**: Linting, formatting, and security scans
- **Testing**: Unit tests, integration tests, and model validation
- **Model Training**: Automated model training and evaluation
- **Deployment**: Model deployment to staging and production

### Pipeline Stages

#### 1. Code Quality
```yaml
- name: Run Black Formatter
  run: black --check .
  
- name: Run Flake8 Linter
  run: flake8 .
  
- name: Run MyPy Type Checker
  run: mypy .
  
- name: Security Scan with Bandit
  run: bandit -r .
```

#### 2. Testing
```yaml
- name: Run Unit Tests
  run: pytest tests/unit/ -v --cov=src/
  
- name: Run Integration Tests
  run: pytest tests/integration/ -v
  
- name: Model Validation Tests
  run: pytest tests/model_tests/ -v
```

#### 3. Model Training Pipeline
```yaml
- name: Train Models
  run: python scripts/train_models.py
  
- name: Evaluate Models
  run: python scripts/evaluate_models.py
  
- name: Model Performance Tests
  run: python scripts/performance_tests.py
```

#### 4. Deployment
```yaml
- name: Deploy to Staging
  if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/develop'
  run: |
    docker build -t ml-model:staging .
    docker push $REGISTRY/ml-model:staging
    
- name: Deploy to Production
  if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
  run: |
    docker build -t ml-model:prod .
    docker push $REGISTRY/ml-model:prod
```

### Model Versioning

- **DVC (Data Version Control)**: Track datasets and model artifacts
- **MLflow**: Model registry and experiment tracking
- **Model Tags**: Semantic versioning for model releases

### Monitoring and Alerts

- **Model Performance**: Automated drift detection
- **Infrastructure**: Resource utilization monitoring
- **Alerts**: Slack/email notifications for failures

### Security Best Practices

- **Secret Management**: Use GitHub Secrets for API keys
- **Image Scanning**: Vulnerability scans for Docker images
- **Access Control**: RBAC for deployment environments
- **Code Signing**: Sign model artifacts for integrity
