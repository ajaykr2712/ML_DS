## ✨ **Key Concept: Problem-Solving by Searching**  
Searching is at the core of problem-solving in AI. Here's a breakdown of some vital search strategies:

### 🔍 **1. Uninformed Search Strategies:**  
These strategies require no additional information about the domain beyond the problem definition. Common examples include:  
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** 🌐: Explores all nodes at the present depth before moving deeper.  
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)** ⬇️: Explores as far down one branch as possible before backtracking.

### 💡 **2. Informed (Heuristic) Search Strategies:**  
These strategies leverage problem-specific knowledge:  
- **Greedy Best-First Search** 🏃‍♂️: Favors nodes closest to the goal based on a heuristic function.  
- **A\* Search** ⭐: Balances the cost of the path and the heuristic value to find optimal solutions.

## 🎮 **Adversarial Search (Games)**  
Adversarial search deals with decision-making in multi-agent environments (e.g., games):  
- **Minimax Algorithm** ♟️: Evaluates the best possible moves for the opponent.  
- **Alpha-Beta Pruning** ✂️: Reduces the nodes evaluated in the Minimax tree.

## 🧠 **The Structure of Agents**  
Agents are entities that perceive and act. Key agent types:  
1. **Simple Reflex Agents** 🤖: Act on the current percept alone.  
2. **Goal-Based Agents** 🎯: Consider actions that lead to desirable outcomes.  
3. **Learning Agents** 📈: Adapt and improve over time based on past actions.

## 🖼️ Sample Visual (Uninformed Search Tree)  
```plaintext
            Start
           /  |  \
          A   B   C
         /|   |
        D E   F
```

This represents a Breadth-First Search exploration order: **Start → A → B → C → D → E → F**
