## 📝 **Day 1 Goals & Tasks:**
Here’s what I aim to accomplish by the end of today:

### 1. **Linear Regression with Multiple Variables**
   - **Objective**: Learn how Linear Regression can be extended to multiple features.
   - **Tasks**:
     - [x] Watch lecture videos on Linear Regression with multiple variables.
     - [x] Understand and implement feature scaling to normalize values.
     - [x] Complete Quiz #2 on this topic.

### 2. **Gradient Descent Optimization**
   - **Objective**: Explore how gradient descent is used to find the optimal parameters for Linear Regression.
   - **Tasks**:
     - [x] Learn the importance of feature scaling for faster convergence.
     - [x] Review examples of gradient descent applied to multiple features.
     - [x] Complete exercises for Gradient Descent and optimization techniques.

## 📌 **Reflections**
- Working with multiple variables introduced the challenge of dimensionality but also demonstrated the power of machine learning for real-world data with multiple features.
- The concept of **feature scaling** was essential for speeding up convergence in gradient descent and is something I plan to apply in future projects.
