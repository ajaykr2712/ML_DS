## 📌 Topics Covered:

### 1. Cross-Validation Techniques:
   - **k-Fold Cross-Validation**: Divides the dataset into k subsets and trains k different models, rotating the validation set each time to ensure the model's generalizability.
   - **Stratified k-Fold**: A version of k-fold where each fold maintains the same class distribution, essential for imbalanced datasets.
   - **Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV)**: Tests each data point separately as a test set, useful for small datasets.

### 2. Evaluation Metrics:
   - **Classification Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and AUC-ROC to gauge model performance for classification tasks.
   - **Regression Metrics**: Explored R², Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) for evaluating regression models.
   - **Advanced Metrics**: Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) and Cohen's Kappa for balanced assessment beyond traditional metrics.

### 3. Model Selection:
   - **Bias-Variance Tradeoff**: Reviewed strategies to manage the trade-off and ensure balanced model performance.
   - **Regularization Techniques**: Understanding the role of L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization to avoid overfitting.
   - **Ensemble Methods**: Analyzed boosting, bagging, and stacking to enhance model accuracy and robustness.
