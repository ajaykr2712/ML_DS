## 📘 Study Focus
Today, I continued my in-depth study of Abhishek Thakur's book, *Approaching (Almost) Any Machine Learning Problem*. The focus areas for the day were:

- **Cross-Validation Techniques** 🧩
- **Evaluation Metrics** 📊
- **Organizing Machine Learning Projects** 📂

---

## 🔑 Key Learnings

1. **Cross-Validation Techniques**:
   - Learned about different methods like **k-fold**, **stratified k-fold**, and **leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV)**.
   - Discovered how proper cross-validation improves model generalizability by simulating real-world performance.
   - Realized the importance of choosing the right validation method to avoid **overfitting** and **data leakage**.

2. **Evaluation Metrics**:
   - Studied **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, **F1 score**, and **ROC-AUC**.
   - Gained insights on selecting the appropriate metric based on **class imbalance** and project requirements.
   - Practiced calculating these metrics using sample datasets, which highlighted where each metric is most valuable.

3. **Project Organization**:
   - Explored methods to structure machine learning projects for reproducibility.
   - Reviewed best practices for version control, modular coding, and documentation.
   - Emphasized the importance of model logging and experiment tracking.

## 📝 Summary

Today's focus helped strengthen my understanding of organizing projects and evaluating model performance. Implementing proper cross-validation and evaluation metrics is crucial for building reliable ML models, while structured project organization ensures easier collaboration and troubleshooting.

---

## 🔍 Challenges Faced

1. **Choosing the Right Metric**:
   - Faced difficulty selecting the most meaningful metric for class-imbalanced datasets. Solutions included applying **precision-recall curves** and comparing **F1 scores** across different models.

2. **Understanding Stratification in k-Fold CV**:
   - Took extra time to comprehend how stratified sampling in cross-validation affects model robustness, especially with skewed datasets.

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Deepen understanding** by experimenting with real-world datasets and testing various cross-validation methods.
2. **Work on a mini-project** that incorporates structured project organization, proper metric evaluation, and experiment logging.
3. Continue reading the next chapters in *Approaching (Almost) Any Machine Learning Problem* and implementing the techniques covered.
