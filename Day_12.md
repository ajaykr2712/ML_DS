---

## ðŸš€ **Today's Agenda**  

1. **Understanding Advanced ML Algorithms**:
   - Focused on **XGBoost** and **LightGBM**.
   - Studied their differences, advantages, and scenarios for practical use.

2. **Model Interpretability**:
   - Explored techniques for interpreting complex models:
     - SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)
     - LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)

3. **Practical Case Study**:
   - Implemented a classification task with **imbalanced data** using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique).  
   - Compared results with balanced
