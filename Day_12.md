## 🔍 Topics Covered

### 1. Evaluation Techniques
   - **Classification Metrics**:
      - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score.
      - ROC-AUC for model comparison.
   - **Regression Metrics**:
      - Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
      - R-squared for explaining model variance.

### 2. Project Structuring
   - **Folder Organization**:
      - **Data Folder**: Storing raw and processed datasets.
      - **Notebooks Folder**: Experiments and exploratory data analysis.
      - **Scripts Folder**: Modular scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
   - **Version Control**: Git setup for tracking changes across datasets, models, and scripts.
   - **Documentation**: Noting down assumptions, data sources, and results for reproducibility.
