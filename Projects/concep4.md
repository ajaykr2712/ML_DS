# Advanced Supervised Learning Projects Roadmap

## Project 3: Financial Market Prediction System

**Complexity Level: Expert**

### Description
Develop a financial market prediction system that:
- Multi-asset price prediction (stocks, crypto, forex, commodities)
- Risk assessment using Value-at-Risk (VaR) metrics
- Portfolio optimization with Sharpe ratio maximization
- Market sentiment analysis using NLP on news/filings
- Automated trading signals with execution probability scoring

### Technical Requirements
- Real-time data ingestion from multiple exchanges/APIs
- Ensemble models (LSTM + Transformer + Prophet)
- Cloud-native deployment with Kubernetes
- Microservices architecture with gRPC/WebSocket APIs
- Integration with trading platforms (MetaTrader, Interactive Brokers)

### Implementation Steps
1. Data Pipeline Development:
   - Build OHLCV data collector with tick-level resolution
   - Create alternative data handlers (order book, social media)
   - Implement data versioning with DVC

2. Model Development Phase:
   - Develop hybrid architecture combining:
     - Temporal Fusion Transformer for time series
     - BERT-based sentiment analysis
     - Portfolio optimization using CVaR
   - Implement online learning for model adaptation

3. Productionization:
   - Build backtesting engine with walk-forward validation
   - Create risk management module with circuit breakers
   - Develop execution system with smart order routing

### Advanced Features
- Alternative data integration (satellite imagery, supply chain data)
- Reinforcement learning for dynamic portfolio allocation
- Explainable AI (XAI) components for regulatory compliance
- Dark pool liquidity prediction models
- Live trading simulation with paper trading interface

### Key Learning Objectives
- Multimodal time series forecasting
- Deep reinforcement learning for finance
- Market microstructure modeling
- Feature engineering for high-frequency data
- Backtesting frameworks with slippage modeling
- Regulatory-compliant ML deployment

### Potential Challenges
- Non-stationary financial time series
- High-dimensional regime switching
- Latency-sensitive model serving
- Data leakage prevention in time series
- Regulatory constraints on automated trading
