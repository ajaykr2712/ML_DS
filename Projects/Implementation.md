# Key features of the implementation:

Regularization types implemented through reg_type parameter ('l1' or 'l2')
Adjustable regularization strength
Gradient descent optimization with regularization penalties
Performance comparison across regularization types
Visualization of weight distributions

The code demonstrates how regularization affects model weights and performance. Run it to see how different regularization types impact feature importance and model accuracy.
