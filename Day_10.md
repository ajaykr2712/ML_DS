### 🗓 Date: November 10, 2024

## 📚 Topics Covered:
- **Feature Engineering**: Understanding the importance of creating meaningful features for model improvement.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing data.
- **Scaling and Transformation**: Techniques like MinMax Scaling, Standardization, and Log Transformation.

## 🔍 Key Learnings:
- **Feature Engineering**:
  - Created new features by combining existing ones and transforming data to enhance model interpretability and performance.
  - Applied polynomial feature transformations to assess their impact on model accuracy.
  
- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Addressed missing data using imputation methods suitable for numerical and categorical variables.
  - Used One-Hot Encoding for categorical data and Label Encoding where necessary.
  - Compared the effects of different normalization techniques to optimize model performance.

- **Scaling and Transformation**:
  - **MinMax Scaling** for bringing all features within the same range, improving performance for distance-based algorithms.
  - **Standardization** to maintain mean of zero and variance of one, useful for algorithms sensitive to feature scaling.
  - **Log Transformation** on skewed data for normal distribution and improved linearity.

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries:
- **Python Libraries**: `pandas`, `numpy`, `sklearn.preprocessing`

## 🔗 Resources:
- **Scikit-Learn Documentation**: [Feature Engineering & Preprocessing](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/preprocessing.html)
- **Coursera**: Andrew Ng’s Machine Learning Course, Week 2 - Data Preparation & Feature Scaling

## 📝 Reflection:
Today’s focus on feature engineering and preprocessing helped me understand the data's role in building better models. The way data is transformed and scaled can significantly impact model results, particularly with algorithms that depend on feature distances.
