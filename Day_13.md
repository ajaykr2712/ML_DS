## 🚀 **Today's Agenda**  
1. **Understanding Advanced ML Algorithms**:
   - Focused on **XGBoost** and **LightGBM**.
   - Studied their differences, advantages, and scenarios for practical use.

2. **Model Interpretability**:
   - Explored techniques for interpreting complex models:
     - SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)
     - LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)

3. **Practical Case Study**:
   - Implemented a classification task with **imbalanced data** using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique).  
   - Compared results with balanced vs. imbalanced datasets.  

4. **Evaluation Metrics**:
   - Experimented with metrics like **Precision-Recall AUC** and **F1-Score** for evaluating imbalanced datasets.

## 📝 **Notes & Takeaways**
- **XGBoost vs. LightGBM**:
  - XGBoost is slightly slower but has robust performance for small datasets.
  - LightGBM is highly efficient with large datasets, thanks to its histogram-based algorithm.  
- **SHAP**:
  - Helps visualize feature contributions, enhancing trust in model predictions.  
- **SMOTE**:
  - A powerful tool for handling class imbalance, but it can introduce noise.

## 📊 **Key Code Snippets**
**Implementing SMOTE for Handling Imbalanced Data**:
```python
from imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report

# Prepare data
smote = SMOTE(random_state=42)
X_resampled, y_resampled = smote.fit_resample(X_train, y_train)

# Train model
clf = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42)
clf.fit(X_resampled, y_resampled)

# Evaluate
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
```
