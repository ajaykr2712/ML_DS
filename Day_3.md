## Topics Covered
- **Cross-Validation**: Explored different types of cross-validation techniques and their roles in ensuring model robustness.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Studied key metrics to assess model performance across diverse problem types.
- **Structuring ML Projects**: Learned strategies for organizing machine learning projects effectively to improve readability, scalability, and collaboration.

## Key Insights
- **Cross-Validation**: Techniques like K-Fold and Stratified K-Fold help in assessing model generalization effectively.
- **Metrics**: Choosing the right evaluation metric is crucial, especially in imbalanced datasets.
- **Project Organization**: Structured workflows contribute to clearer project stages and better iteration handling.

## Next Steps
1. Practice cross-validation and metric selection on Kaggle datasets.
2. Begin implementing a small project using these guidelines to reinforce todayâ€™s concepts.
