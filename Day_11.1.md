# Install Necessary Libraries
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn


# Import and use the classes as needed:

# Create instances
evaluator = ModelEvaluation(X, y)
model_selection = ModelSelection()

# Perform evaluation
results = evaluator.perform_kfold_cv(model_selection.models['rf'])


## This implementation provides a solid foundation for machine learning model evaluation and selection. You can extend it further based on your specific needs.
