**Important Notes:**
1. Rates vary annually and by sub-area
2. Workshop acceptances are generally higher
3. Journal impact factors â‰  conference rankings
4. Regional biases exist (e.g., AAAI vs IJCAI)
5. Newer venues (e.g., TMLR) are gaining traction
6. "Difficulty" considers both acceptance rate and reviewer expectations

Would you like me to provide additional details about any particular venue or submission strategies for specific levels?
