# Computer Vision Advanced Architectures

## Vision Transformers (ViT) Implementation Guide

### Architecture Overview
Vision Transformers apply the transformer architecture directly to sequences of image patches, treating image classification as a sequence-to-sequence prediction task.

### Key Components

#### 1. Patch Embedding
```python
class PatchEmbedding(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, img_size=224, patch_size=16, in_chans=3, embed_dim=768):
        super().__init__()
        self.patch_size = patch_size
        self.num_patches = (img_size // patch_size) ** 2
        self.proj = nn.Conv2d(in_chans, embed_dim, kernel_size=patch_size, stride=patch_size)
    
    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.proj(x)  # (B, embed_dim, H/patch_size, W/patch_size)
        x = x.flatten(2).transpose(1, 2)  # (B, num_patches, embed_dim)
        return x
```

#### 2. Multi-Head Self-Attention
- Enables the model to attend to different parts of the image
- Captures long-range dependencies effectively
- More efficient than convolutional operations for global context

#### 3. Position Embeddings
- Learnable position embeddings added to patch embeddings
- Essential since transformers lack inherent positional awareness
- Can use 1D or 2D positional encodings

### Advanced Architectures

#### Swin Transformer
- Hierarchical vision transformer with shifted windows
- Reduces computational complexity from quadratic to linear
- Better suited for dense prediction tasks

#### DeiT (Data-efficient Image Transformers)
- Knowledge distillation for training ViTs efficiently
- Teacher-student framework with CNN teachers
- Achieves competitive results with less data

#### DETR (Detection Transformer)
- End-to-end object detection with transformers
- Eliminates need for hand-crafted components like NMS
- Direct set prediction approach

### Implementation Tips

1. **Data Augmentation**: Use strong augmentation techniques
2. **Warmup**: Long warmup periods are crucial for training
3. **Layer Scaling**: Apply layer scaling for training stability
4. **Mixed Precision**: Use automatic mixed precision for efficiency

### Performance Optimizations

- **Gradient Checkpointing**: For memory efficiency
- **Flash Attention**: Faster attention computation
- **Knowledge Distillation**: Transfer knowledge from larger models
- **Progressive Resizing**: Start with smaller images, gradually increase

### Applications

1. **Image Classification**: ImageNet, CIFAR-100
2. **Object Detection**: COCO, Open Images
3. **Semantic Segmentation**: ADE20K, Cityscapes
4. **Medical Imaging**: X-ray analysis, MRI segmentation
5. **Satellite Imagery**: Land use classification, change detection

### Recent Advances
