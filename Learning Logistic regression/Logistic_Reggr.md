# This implementation includes all the components you requested:

1.
Weight initialization: In the initialize_parameters method.
2.
Gradient descent optimization: In the fit method, which uses compute_gradients and update_parameters.
3.
Sigmoid function for probability prediction: In the sigmoid method.
4.
Loss function (Log-Loss): In the compute_cost method.
5.
Model training and prediction: In the fit, predict_proba, and predict methods.


The script also includes a sample dataset generation and evaluation of the model using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics.

To run this script, save it as logistic_regression_from_scratch.py and execute it using Python. The output will show the accuracy, precision, and recall of the model on the test set.

This implementation demonstrates a basic logistic regression model without using external machine learning libraries. It's important to note that while this implementation is educational, it may not be as optimized or feature-rich as libraries like Scikit-learn. For production use or more complex scenarios, it's generally recommended to use well-established libraries that have been thoroughly tested and optimized.
