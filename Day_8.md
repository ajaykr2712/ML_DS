## üìö Topics Covered
1. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Methods to handle categorical and numerical features.
   - Techniques for scaling, encoding, and transforming data for improved model performance.
2. **Dimensionality Reduction**:
   - Principal Component Analysis (PCA), t-SNE, and LDA.
   - When and why to use dimensionality reduction techniques to improve computation time and performance.
Feature Engineering & Data Preprocessing
Objective: Exploring techniques for feature engineering and data preprocessing to improve model performance.

Code Snippets:
python
Copy code
# Importing necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, OneHotEncoder
from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline

# Sample dataset
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'age': [25, 32, 47, 51, 62],
    'income': [50000, 60000, 70000, 80000, 90000],
    'city': ['New York', 'Los Angeles', 'New York', 'Chicago', 'Chicago']
})

# Preprocessing Pipeline
numeric_features = ['age', 'income']
categorical_features = ['city']

# Creating transformers
numeric_transformer = StandardScaler()
categorical_transformer = OneHotEncoder()

# Combining transformations
preprocessor = ColumnTransformer(
    transformers=[
        ('num', numeric_transformer, numeric_features),
        ('cat', categorical_transformer, categorical_features)
    ])

# Building a preprocessing pipeline
pipeline = Pipeline(steps=[('preprocessor', preprocessor)])
processed_data = pipeline.fit_transform(data)

# Result
print("Processed Data:")
print(processed_data)
Key Steps
Scaling: Standardizing numerical features for improved model efficiency.
Encoding: One-hot encoding categorical features for compatibility with ML models.
Pipeline Creation: Combining steps for streamlined preprocessing.

## üîç Key Insights
- **Feature Engineering**:
  - Learned the importance of selecting relevant features and transforming them to enhance model accuracy.
  - Applied one-hot encoding, label encoding, and standardization to prepare data for ML models.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**:
  - PCA was particularly useful in reducing features without losing significant information.
  - t-SNE is valuable for visualizing high-dimensional data but requires careful tuning of hyperparameters.

## üîó Resources
- **Kaggle Datasets** for practical feature engineering exercises.
- **Scikit-learn Documentation**: Referenced the official documentation for various feature transformation techniques.
- **PCA Explained**: A tutorial on using PCA for dimensionality reduction.

## üìù Reflection
Today‚Äôs focus on feature engineering and dimensionality reduction gave me deeper insights into data preparation, a critical aspect of ML that often determines model success.

## ‚è≠ Next Steps
- Experiment with feature selection methods like Lasso and Ridge regression.
- Practice dimensionality reduction on a more complex dataset to gauge performance impact.
