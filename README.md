## 💡 **Key Areas of Focus for Day 0:**
To start with discipline and focus, here are the areas I plan to cover:

### 1. **Setting up Tools & Environment:**
   - Ensure all ML libraries are installed (e.g., `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `tensorflow`).
   - Organize GitHub repository with folders for scripts, notebooks, and resources.
   - Download and set up Jupyter Notebook for project management and notes.

### 2. **Setting Learning Goals:**
   - Define clear objectives and target concepts in each topic for Week 1.
   - Break down larger projects into small, manageable milestones to stay motivated.

### 3. **Establishing Accountability:**
   - Begin logging daily progress, insights, and challenges here in this repository.
   - Post regular updates on social media (e.g., Twitter, LinkedIn) to connect with others on a similar journey.
