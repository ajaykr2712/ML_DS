## 🗺️ Migration Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup (Week 1)
**Goal**: Establish the new structure and development environment

#### Tasks:
1. **Create New Structure**
   ```bash
   # Create the new directory structure
   mkdir -p src/{core,data,features,models,evaluation,deployment,monitoring,mlops,utils,cli}
   mkdir -p tests/{unit,integration,performance,fixtures,e2e}
   mkdir -p docs/{guides,api,tutorials,examples,architecture,research}
   mkdir -p configs/{models,data,training,deployment,logging}
   mkdir -p {notebooks,scripts,deployment,experiments,reports,assets}
   ```

2. **Setup Development Environment**
   ```bash
   # Initialize new configuration files
   touch requirements.txt requirements-dev.txt setup.py pyproject.toml
   touch Makefile docker-compose.yml .gitignore .env.example
   touch .pre-commit-config.yaml
   ```

3. **Create Base Classes and Interfaces**

- ✅ Initial CI/CD pipeline

### Phase 2: Core ML Migration (Weeks 2-3)
**Goal**: Migrate and organize core ML algorithms

#### Current → New Mapping:

| Current Location | New Location | Action Required |
|------------------|--------------|-----------------|
| `ML_Implementation/advanced_ensemble.py` | `src/core/algorithms/supervised/ensemble_methods.py` | Refactor, add tests |
| `ML_Implementation/neural_architecture_search.py` | `src/models/automl/neural_architecture_search.py` | Move, enhance docs |
| `ML_Implementation/hyperparameter_optimization.py` | `src/core/training/hyperparameter_tuning.py` | Refactor, modularize |
| `ML_Implementation/deep_learning_architectures.py` | `src/models/deep_learning/architectures/` | Split into modules |
| `ML_Implementation/model_interpretability.py` | `src/evaluation/interpretation/` | Split by method |

from pathlib import Path

def migrate_ensemble_methods():
    """Migrate ensemble method implementations"""
    source = "ML_Implementation/advanced_ensemble.py"
    target = "src/core/algorithms/supervised/ensemble_methods.py"
    
    # Read source file
    with open(source, 'r') as f:
        content = f.read()
    
    # Apply transformations
    content = add_proper_imports(content)
    content = add_type_hints(content)
    content = add_docstrings(content)
    content = refactor_classes(content)
    
    # Write to new location
    with open(target, 'w') as f:
        f.write(content)
    
    # Create corresponding test file
    create_test_file(target)
